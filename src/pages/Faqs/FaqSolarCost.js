                                        Solar panels are designed to be outside on your roof or on a ground
                                        mounted system for decades. We have seen them sustain really he-
                                        avy hail-storms without damage. In some cases the panels have ou-
                                        tlasted shingle and metal roof that needed to get replaced after a
                                        storm while the solar system was fine. In a situation like that we will
                                        work with your roofer to take the system down, let the roofing comp-
                                        any replace your roof, and then reinstall your system. This is typically
                                        covered under your home insurance policy.

                                    is attractive to modern homebuyers looking for homes
                                    that have upgrades for energy efficiencies such as new
                                    windows, and energy star air conditioner units. Studies
                                    show that solar increases the value of your home, espe-
                                    cially in the Kansas City and surrounding markets. Histo-

                                    with the added equity. If you are thinking about buying
                                    or selling a home with Solar we recommend contacting
