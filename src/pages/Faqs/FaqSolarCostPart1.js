                                        when preparing a quote for your home to look for concerns that
                                        need to be addressed before solar is installed. We will not proceed
                                        with a solar installation if the appears to need to be replaced. In the
                                        event that you have a roof that needs to be replaced AFTER you ha-
                                        ve installed solar our Helio GreenTech solar installers will work with
                                        your roofing company and insurance company to remove the solar
                                        panels before your roof is replaced and reinstalled after your roof is
                                        repaired or replaced. The solar panels themselves will actually help
                                        shield that section of shingles from the sun and other destructive el-
                                        ements, helping to extend the life of the shingles!

                                        What about weather? How do clouds,
                                        rain, snow, and ice affect a solar system?

                                        Your system will be affected by weather. Our systems
                                        are designed with state of the art technology and so-
                                        ftware that helps predict your annual production. This
                                        production is backed by our production guarantee.
                                        Solar will be reduced when it’s cloudy, but still should
                                        produce some power even on cloudy days. Solar en-
                                        ergy operates off of energy from the sun which pen-
                                        etrates cloud coverage. Snow and ice can also affect
                                        your production. For safety reasons we don’t recom-
                                        mend getting outside to wipe off your panels. Just
                                        let the sun do the work for you! The panels are black
                                        and as light hits the sleek all black panels they will
                                        get hot, and the snow and ice will slide right off to let
                                        your panels produce power again quickly. Though,
                                        when it’s sunny enough we’ve seen solar system pro-
                                        duce a good amount of power even under a little bl-

                                        Solar panels help improve the environment. Each day the sun shines 73,000 terawatts of solar energy on Earth, which is more energy <br />
                                        in 1.5 hours than humans use in an entire year! So we know it’s a good source of energy, but what is the impact on the environment?

                                            <li>The average homeowner would need to plant over 150 trees to offset the same carbon over a 25 year period as just one solar
                                                system</li>
                                            <li>A pound of coal roughly creates 1 kWh, that means the average homeowner in Kansas City, MO uses about 17,000 Lbs of coal to <br />
                                                 power their home each year. A solar system over 25 years could offset about  500,000 lbs of coal over the same 25 year period!</li>
                                            <li>If 14% of US electricity is gathered via solar, air pollution would cause $167 billion less in health and environmental damages.</li>
                                            <li>Widespread solar adoption would eliminate air pollutants that cause many respiratory and cardiovascular problems.</li>
                                            <li>Solar works during heat waves and droughts without water, unlike coal, gas and nuclear power which can use up and damage needed resources.</li>
                                            <li>In short, yes, solar power really makes a big impact on the environment! </li>
